Priority: P0 is normal; greater means higher priority and vice versa.

- P3:  More support for non-S60 devices by updating the specific 'terminalTools_OS' modules and the main 'terminalTools' module:
I thought using the platform independant python module 'colorama' and 'pyHook' (windows) / 'python-xlib' (linux and mac).
- P2:  Optimalize the code (more ObjectOriented) to ease use of the Terminal in other PyS60 apps such as Python IDE's like PED.
- P2:  Support for executing Python apps using gui of appuifw (mainly because if the external app quits, 
- P2:  Api doc for module 'terminalTools'.
- P0:  Some testing on executing Symbian-executables.
- P0:  Massive testing whether the apps behaves correctly while executing more complex code.
- P0:  More examples/demos.
- P-1: Determine to implement the ascii color codes instead of using a style tuple passing through terminalTools.print_special(...), and relevant functions.
- P-2: Check for KeyboardInterrupt whiles calling stdout.write().
the signal is given to lock, which then quits both external app and the Terminal itself.) See also first item.
- P-2: Bold support for non-S60 devices.
